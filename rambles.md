# Svelte tutorial bruh
- Componenty thing, like react. One component per file.
- ik u gon forget this but capitalize compoment names
- svelte  routes shit using file system
- inside src/routes, +page.svelte file creates a page in app. (+page.svelte auto maps to /)
- layouts applies to all routes in the dame directory 


## Comoponents
- components are reusable, self-contained units to represent a piece of UI. Can manage its own state or also recieve data from parent components.
- can also do effects manually if something updated but not reccommended to do so 
 - components have script, html and style. Styles are scope to each individual component. 

## Runes
- this stuff lets you loop through things
- can do <Card {..product} /> to list through and pass in props of product to the Card (example from a tutorial)
 

## vite 
- kind of like a backend server ig
- uses index.html as entry point; (index.hmtml ahs main.js as a script so it then tries to serve that up.)
